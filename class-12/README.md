### Feedback Surveys


"The code reviews have been very benificial for me. Discussing the code and seeing different ways to do it has helped me understand the process better."

"I thought the more CSS work and the extra git work was really helpful. I also thought it was great that we have more room in remo now!"

"I feel like I don't know anything. The only way I can complete a lab is turning in nothing, watching the code-review and then coding it again step-by-step with the code-review on frontrow. Without that level of hand holding I'm lost."

"Maybe make the career portion of the class voluntary and not graded. Although the information is very beneficial and useful, making it part of the class grade seems unnecessary."

"The pair programming exercise this week was good.  It was nice to be able to trade little short cuts in doing things.  Which, you never really know you know or know you don't know until you are coding with someone and notice how they do things. "

"I think the teachers need to spend more individual time with each student. maybe weekly checkins for a few weeks I was struggling and i didnt get any feedback from anyone. I was stressing that i wouldnt pass the class and it would have been nice to have a check in based on where my assignments were at during that time.  As a client I would like to feel that I am getting the instruction and support that I am paying for while learning and achieving my goal."
