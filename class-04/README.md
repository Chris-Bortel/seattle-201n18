## Survey

### Least Helpful
- Transitioning to fully online was not fun. I was looking forward to being in an actual classroom so that I could immediately focus on the learning and not have to do at-home sessions. I understand it was avoidable though and everyone is struggling and this time. 
- I understand the idea of break out sessions for us to do lab, but I *personally* would rather work on labs in my own vacuum. The zoom break out rooms are a great way to simulate breaking a class out to different tables as CF does on campus, but I *personally* would rather not do either. Iâ€™d prefer to slack cohort member, TA, or instructor if/when I need help and jump into a breakout room then vs being on zoom (muted and buried under my other windows) the whole lab time.
- I was hoping the lecture on Loops this past Saturday would help me better understand loops from the reading we did/ brief foray in 102. But if anything I think the lecture confused me more...
- Struggling to balance work as essential personnel with school and other obligations.  I'm sure others are experiencing the same.  Conflicting commitments due to the current stay at home order.


### Most Helpful
- I found code review and demo the most helpful. Sometimes i get stuck on just how to even start so those things combined let me see other peoples points of view and kind of starts me off a little more confident.
- The way the assignments are written. They give enough information to point you in the right direction but you still need to google and solve some things on your own. The ability to see lecture demos and translate the info into your own scenario (vs verbatim) is key to learning!
- I SO prefer this setup to the 102 schedule. Having a few days to focus on one lab/topic before moving on is helping me feel far more grounded than continuously jumping from one thing to the next. I realize that's how stacked learning works, but this pace is still much better for me.
- I am learning a lot about coding so far and I am able to write the code and can teach what i've learned 
- Breakout rooms and screen share ability.  Great to have one on one with classmates and hash out problems with peers.
- I think code reviews. 
- I thought was Wednesday was helpful getting us set up for the lab.


## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 4 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of how functions work in JavaScript, as well as the component pieces including declarations, calls, parameters, arguments, and returns, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of CSS layout principles including block, inline, normal, relative, absolute, float, and fixed, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Be able to successfully pair program with a fellow student and manage the collaborative and version control aspects of working with Git (from the command line) and GitHub (in the browser), as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.

## PAIR PROGRAMMING

Here's the basics of what you need to know about *pair programming*. This is a methodology for work in software development that is increasingly more popular and widespread (not only in development work, but also in interview processes), and we place a high value on training our students to pair program effectively. There's more details in the lab assignment.

- In pair programming there are two developers working on a single body of code on a single computer.
- One member of the pair is the Driver, and this person will be the one doing all of the actual typing work on the laptop. The Driver will be working on the Navigator's code by way of forking and cloning the Navigator's repository.
- The other member of the pair is the Navigator, and this person will work with only their voice and their thoughts.
- The Navigator does not touch the keyboard, nor does the Navigator work on their laptop "on the side". The Navigator is fully engaged with the work that the pair is doing, typically using a piece of scratch paper to sketch diagrams, take notes, or list ideas. At most the Navigator uses their laptop to perhaps keep a copy of this assignment document open or to look up something needed to write the code, such as a reference page like MDN.
- Under no circumstances does the Navigator work on any code on their laptop: for the pair programming process to be effective, both parties must be fully engaged on the code they're working on together.
- The lab time should be divided into two sections of approximately two hours each. At the halfway mark, you should swap roles and work on the other person's code. Remember to watch the clock and determine the best point to swap roles.
- In the case of an odd number of students, one group will have three members and they should rotate through three roles: Driver, Navigator, Observer. Each student should take on each role one time. They will need to be even more mindful about watching the clock to ensure that equal time is devoted to all three roles.
