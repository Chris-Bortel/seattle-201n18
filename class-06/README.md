## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 6 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to translate a real-world problem domain into a code model by using provided user stories and technical requirements, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how the browser represents an HTML document as an object that can be manipulated with JavaScript, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically render array data as an unordered list in the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how object literals are structured in JavaScript, as well as how to access and reassign values/functionality to their properties and methods, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how dot notation and bracket notation are used to access/reassign properties and methods in JavaScript objects, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
